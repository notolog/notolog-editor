## Installation

Ensure **Python 3.9 or higher** is installed. For more details, visit [python.org](https://python.org).

Using a virtual environment is recommended to avoid version conflicts. From Python 3.6, venv is the recommended method to create virtual environments. For more information check [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Alternatively, you can execute the Notolog source code and set up virtual environment with your favorite Python code editor.

### Install with pip

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv notolog_env
source notolog_env/bin/activate  # macOS and Linux systems
notolog_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

Install Notolog using pip:
```sh
pip install notolog
```

Starting the app is as simple as running:
```sh
notolog
```

The app includes a 'Check for Updates' option accessible through the main menu under 'Help'. Where applicable, run the following command to update Notolog to the latest version: `pip install notolog --upgrade`

<details>
<summary>How to install venv on Linux systems üîß </summary>

While Python itself usually comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, some distributions may not include the venv module by default. Therefore, you need to install it separately using the package manager before you can use it to create virtual environments.

**Ubuntu/Debian**
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

**Fedora**
```sh
sudo dnf install python3-venv
```

**CentOS/RHEL**
```sh
sudo yum install python3-venv
```
</details>

### Install via conda-forge

Create and activate a new environment:
```sh
conda create -n notolog_env python=3.11
conda activate notolog_env
```

Then, execute the installation command:
```sh
conda install notolog -c conda-forge
```

This will fetch and install the latest version of Notolog compatible with Python 3.9 or newer from the [conda-forge packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/notolog).

Run Notolog:
```sh
notolog
```

Just activate the environment and run the app next time.

### Install from Source

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/notolog/notolog-editor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd notolog-editor
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv notolog_env
source notolog_env/bin/activate  # macOS and Linux systems
notolog_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

4. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install .
```

5. Start Notolog using:
```sh
python -m notolog.app
```


## Tests and Test Coverage

To minimize installation overhead and streamline dependency management, dependencies required solely for testing are isolated in test-specific requirements.

To install these dependencies, run: `python dev_install.py test`. The `tomli` package is required to execute this script; you can install it using `pip install tomli`.

This approach helps manage test dependencies independently from the main application dependencies, ensuring a cleaner and more manageable setup.

<details>
<summary>Run Tests</summary>

To execute all available tests:
```sh
pytest
```

To run tests from a specific file:
```sh
pytest tests/test_pkg_integration.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Run Tests with Coverage Reports</summary>

To run all tests with a coverage report:
```sh
pytest tests/ --cov=notolog --cov-report=term
```

Alternatively, to exclude UI tests from execution:
```sh
pytest tests/ --cov=notolog --cov-report=term --ignore=tests/ui_tests/
```
</details>


## Dev Tools

To maintain high standards of code quality and ensure comprehensive test coverage, we utilize several development tools. Flake8, which combines PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe's complexity checker, is employed to enforce code quality, manage code complexity, and ensure adherence to PEP 8 style conventions.

To install these dependencies, run: `python dev_install.py dev`. The `tomli` package is required to execute this script; you can install it using `pip install tomli`.


## Build Tools

Make sure `poetry-core` and `build` are installed:
```
pip install poetry-core build
```

The following command generates distribution packages. Specifically, it creates both a source distribution and a wheel distribution:
```
python -m build
```
