There is no classical web engine integration to make overall package more lightweight and to achieve the best possible performance.


## Prerequisites

**Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system.**

If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official website [python.org](python.org).

Check the version of Python available with this command `python3 -V`.

**pip (Python package installer) should be available.**

You can check if pip is installed by running `pip3 --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

**Virtual Environment**

It is highly recommended to use as it helps avoid version conflicts and interference from other packages. Below is a description of how to set up a virtual environment on your machine.


## Installation

### Method 1: pip installer (Recommended)

```sh
pip install notolog
```

That's it! Starting the app is as simple as `notolog`.

To update to the latest version, use:
```sh
pip install --upgrade notolog
```

### Method 2: Python source code

0. Open Terminal.
1. Clone project's GitHub repository to get a latest version.
	* `git clone https://github.com/notolog/notolog-editor.git`
2. Navigate to the just cloned project's directory using the **cd** command.
3. Make sure the virtual environment is activated as it's a common practice to isolate project code (activation described below).
4. Simply run this command to set up project dependencies:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! Starting the app is as simple as `python3 main.py`

<details>
<summary>Run tests</summary>

To run all available tests:
```sh
pytest
```

To run a particular file's tests:
```sh
pytest tests/test_notolog_editor.py
```
</details>

### Virtual Environments

The instructions below contain steps of how to set up **venv** virtual environment to run a Python app safely. Starting from Python 3.6 **venv** is a recommended way to create virtual environments. For more information check [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Alternatively, you can execute the Notolog code and set up virtual environment with your favorite Python code editor.

#### MacOS and Linux

##### Set Up Virtual Environment
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the cd command.
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv notolog`. Replace **notolog** with the desired name for your virtual environment.

##### Activate Virtual Environment:
To activate the virtual environment, run:
```sh
source notolog/bin/activate
```

To deactivate environment just run this command:
```sh
deactivate
```

<details>
<summary>Install venv on Linux systems</summary>

While Python itself comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, some distributions may not include the venv module by default. Therefore, you need to install it separately using the package manager before you can use it to create virtual environments.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

**Fedora**

```sh
sudo dnf install python3-venv
```

**CentOS/RHEL**

```sh
sudo yum install python3-venv
```
</details>

#### Windows

##### Set Up Virtual Environment

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv notolog`. Replace **notolog** with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

##### Activate Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run:
```
notolog\Scripts\activate
```
_Mind the environment name (**notolog** or any other selected before)._

## Security Disclaimer

This application is primarily designed for educational purposes and uses PBKDF2HMAC for key derivation. It employs Fernet, which utilizes AES-128 in CBC mode. The key is initially created at 256 bits but truncated to 128 bits for encryption. The encryption salt and iteration counts are stored unencrypted in the file's header, making this setup suitable for educational and non-critical applications only. As such, while this software provides basic security, it is not intended for high-security needs. Users are encouraged to choose strong passwords to enhance data protection. Distributed under the MIT License, this open-source application requires users to ensure compliance with applicable laws, and the developers disclaim liability for misuse or legal non-compliance.
