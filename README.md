## Prerequisites

Ensure **Python 3.9 or higher** is installed on your system. For installation details, visit [python.org](https://python.org).

Check the installed Python version:

```bash
python3 -V
```

Verify pip availability:

```bash
pip --version
```

**Virtual Environment**

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended as it helps avoid version conflicts and interference from other packages.


## Installation

### Using pip (Recommended)

Install Notolog quickly using pip:

```sh
pip install notolog
```

That's it! Starting the app is as simple as `notolog`.

To update Notolog to the latest version:
```sh
pip install --upgrade notolog
```

### From Source

To install from source for more control over the installation process:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/notolog/notolog-editor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd notolog-editor
```

3. Set up a virtual environment (highly recommended):
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

4. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install .
```

Start Notolog using:
```sh
python -m notolog.app
```

### Tests and Test Coverage

To minimize installation overhead and streamline dependency management, dependencies required solely for testing are isolated in test-specific requirements.

To install these dependencies, run: `python dev_install.py test`. The `tomli` package is required to execute this script; you can install it using `pip install tomli`.

This approach helps manage test dependencies independently from the main application dependencies, ensuring a cleaner and more manageable setup.

<details>
<summary>Run Tests</summary>

To execute all available tests:
```sh
pytest
```

To run tests from a specific file:
```sh
pytest tests/test_pkg_integration.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Run Tests with Coverage Reports</summary>

To run all tests with a coverage report:
```sh
pytest tests/ --cov=notolog --cov-report=term
```

Alternatively, to exclude UI tests from execution:
```sh
pytest tests/ --cov=notolog --cov-report=term --ignore=tests/ui_tests/
```
</details>

### Dev Tools

To maintain high standards of code quality and ensure comprehensive test coverage, we utilize several development tools. Flake8, which combines PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe's complexity checker, is employed to enforce code quality, manage code complexity, and ensure adherence to PEP 8 style conventions.

To install these dependencies, run: `python dev_install.py dev`. The `tomli` package is required to execute this script; you can install it using `pip install tomli`.

### Build Tools

Make sure `poetry-core` and `build` are installed:
```
pip install poetry-core build
```

The following command generates distribution packages. Specifically, it creates both a source distribution and a wheel distribution:
```
python -m build
```

### Virtual Environments

The instructions below contain steps of how to set up **venv** virtual environment to run a Python app safely. Starting from Python 3.6 **venv** is a recommended way to create virtual environments. For more information check [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Alternatively, you can execute the Notolog code and set up virtual environment with your favorite Python code editor.

#### Linux and macOS

##### Set Up Virtual Environment
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the cd command.
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv notolog`. Replace **notolog** with the desired name for your virtual environment.

##### Activate Virtual Environment:
To activate the virtual environment, run:
```sh
source notolog/bin/activate
```

To deactivate environment just run this command:
```sh
deactivate
```

<details>
<summary>Install venv on Linux systems</summary>

While Python itself comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, some distributions may not include the venv module by default. Therefore, you need to install it separately using the package manager before you can use it to create virtual environments.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

**Fedora**

```sh
sudo dnf install python3-venv
```

**CentOS/RHEL**

```sh
sudo yum install python3-venv
```
</details>

#### Windows

##### Set Up Virtual Environment

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv notolog`. Replace **notolog** with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

##### Activate Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run:
```
notolog\Scripts\activate
```
_Mind the environment name (**notolog** or any other selected before)._
